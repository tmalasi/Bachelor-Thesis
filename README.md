# Bachelor-Thesis
Emotion recognition has garnered significant attention across various disciplines, with 
Electroencephalography (EEG) emerging as a promising modality for decoding human 
emotions. This bachelor thesis investigates the feasibility and efficacy of utilizing EEG 
signals from the DREAMER dataset for emotion recognition. The study begins with a 
comprehensive overview of emotion characterization, encompassing both discrete and 
multi-dimensional perspectives. Additionally, it explores the intricate anatomy of the 
human brain and outlines the process of EEG data acquisition. Emphasizing EEG's role 
in emotion recognition, the thesis addresses electrode positioning, artifact mitigation 
techniques, and the establishment of a robust framework for emotion recognition. 
The literature review delves into the methodologies employed in emotion recognition 
tasks, highlighting machine learning and deep learning techniques. Several datasets, including DEAP, SEED, and MAHNOB HCI-tagging, are discussed, with the 
experimental focus on the DREAMER dataset. Methodologically, the study details 
preprocessing steps to enhance EEG data quality, such as bandpass filtering, power 
spectral density calculation, and baseline-stimulus ratio calculation. It also elaborates on 
feature extraction techniques in the frequency and time domains and discusses various 
metrics used to evaluate the accuracy of emotion recognition models. 
The results and discussion section presents insights gathered from experiments conducted 
on the DREAMER dataset, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed methodologies in 
emotion recognition tasks. The thesis concludes by suggesting future research directions 
and highlighting the potential applications of EEG-based emotion recognition systems in 
diverse domains. 
Overall, this thesis advances our understanding of emotion recognition through EEG 
analysis using the DREAMER dataset and lays the groundwork for practical applications 
in healthcare, human-computer interaction, and affective computing.
